```
3 Models of cloud services :
1) SaaS	(Software as a Srvice)
2) PaaS	(Platform as a Service)
3) IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)
```

**SaaS**

Different softwares are provided directly, no need to download and install at client side.
User is not responsible for hardware or software update.
Can be used for short term projects that require quick and affordable collaboration.
Examples : Tableau, Splunk, Storm,etc.
 *** 

**PaaS**

Instead of providing software, it provides platform for software creation.
Developer has to focus only on software development without the worrying about O.S., Storage, Saoftware updates, etc.
Examples : Hosted db RDS., AWS Elastic Beanstalk,etc.
 *** 

**IaaS**

Raw computing resources.
Provides access to resources like - servers,storage and netwroking.
Examples : VM: Ec-2, Volume,etc.
 *** 

**Firewall**

Monitors all incoming and outgoung traffic and accepts, rejests or drops the traffic based on predefined security rules.
Designed to prevent unautorized access to or from a private network.
It can be hardware or software based.
Creates a barrier between private network and outside untrusted networks.
AWS Firewall : Security Groups
 ***

**Security group**

2 Sets of rules:

Inbound - Controls incoming traffic
Outbound - Controls outgoing traffic
These rules can be used for open/close port while remotely accessing the system.

We can create different security groups and can manage ports.

We can use same security group for different instances if needed or can create new group for new instance.

 **Service 2 - S3 S3 - Storage Secured Service**

We can store any type of data in form of object.
Unlimited storage space available.
Bucket needs to be created where we can store our data.
S3 does not require region separation.
Bucket name has to be unique across AWS.
Bucket is like a folder, we can create folders inside it.
We can upload or download files to or from these folders, but we cannot create a file here.
Guarantee of backup from AWS.
Can connect with EC2 also.
We can host a website here.
