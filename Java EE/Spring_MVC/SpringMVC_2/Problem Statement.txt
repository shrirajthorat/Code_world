Entity
Note:- Use HibernateTemplate for this assignment and DAO design pattern.

Product
	int pid  primary key
	pname String
	price double
	qty   int


Home.jsp
	two links

	add product
	view product

when u click on "add product" link , it should take u to 
"Add.jsp" which will accept pname, price and qty.
on submit , record should be entered in "product" table and control should go back to "Home.jsp".

when u click on "view products" link, it should take u to "View.jsp" which will display all the products from "product" table.

Use DAO

ProductDAO
	void add(Product);
	List<?> getProducts();
